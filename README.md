This is the code and sketches repository for [this series of video tutorials](https://youtu.be/tE599G1Hsg0)

You can look at the image sketches that correspond to each part of the video series and you can also open the fritzing_final_sketch.fzz file with the [Fritzing Software](http://fritzing.org/home/) if you want to modify the final sketch to your own needs.

Libraries used:

The downloaded libraries should be added to your Arduino "libraries" folder. The folder is usually somewhere like "E:\Arduino\libraries".
